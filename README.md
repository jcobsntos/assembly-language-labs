# 🖥️ Assembly Language Labs using TASM

Welcome to my collection of laboratory exercises 🧪 developed in **Assembly Language** with **TASM (Turbo Assembler)**.  
These projects showcase fundamental programming concepts, arithmetic, logic, and interactivity in low-level x86 assembly language.  
Perfect for learning the basics of assembly programming and exploring how computers work under the hood! ⚙️
